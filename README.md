This repository contains the code files for the assignments the user had done for the Udemy Course: SystemVerilog for Verification Part 1: Fundamentals.
This repository's purpose is to showcase what the user has learned in the course.
The codes were tested at EDA playground before uploading onto github.
Assignment agenda is written on top of each code file.

Extra note for syntax of assignment name: first digit represents which section, second digit represents which assignment of the section.
Example: Assignment-A32 would mean that this is the 2nd assignment in section 3 of the course.

Extra note 2: The section for 7 and 8 were reversed in the Udemy course for some reasons, therefore the student manually changed the name so that A7n is in section 7 and A8n is in section 8.

Extra note 3: For section 8, design codes were given too, therefore there are testbench and design files for each assignment and thus the syntax change for the naming.
