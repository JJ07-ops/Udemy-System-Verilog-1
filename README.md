This repository contains the code files for the assignments I have done for the Udemy Course: SystemVerilog for Verification Part 1: Fundamentals.
This repository's purpose is to showcase what the user has learned in the course.
The codes were tested at EDA playground before uploading onto github.

Extra note for syntax of assignment name: first digit represents which section, second digit represents which assignment of the section.

Example: Assignment-A32 would mean that this is the 2nd assignment in section 3 of the course.
